# Predicting Student At-Risk Status Using Early Semester Performance Indicators

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies students at risk of academic failure early in the semester.  By analyzing early semester performance indicators, the model enables proactive intervention strategies, ultimately contributing to improved student retention rates.  The analysis involves exploring various machine learning techniques to build a robust and accurate predictive model.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```


## Example Output

The script will print key performance indicators and model evaluation metrics to the console.  This includes information such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  Additionally, the script generates visualizations (e.g., feature importance plots, ROC curves) that are saved as PNG files in the `output` directory.  These visualizations provide insights into the model's performance and the relative importance of different input features.  The exact output files generated may vary depending on the model selected and analysis performed.
